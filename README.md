## Introduction to Survival Analysis

#### **Final Project: Simulation of Mixture Cure Models**

<br>

I reviewed Othus (2012) and learned that mixture cure models model the population for the possiblity of 2 types of patients: cured and not cured. Cured patients will not fail, or experience the event of interest such as cancer or HIV, during the study, whereas non cured patients will. A cure model might be appropriate if the Kaplan-Meier plot has a long plataeau at the right tail. A population with a cure fraction can violate certain assumptions in conventional survival analysis methods, including proportional hazards.

â€‹This final project is a simulation of a parametric mixture cure model in the R programming language. In a nested for loop, we varied the sample size (N = 10, 100, 1000), the hazard rate (lambda = 1, 1.5, 2, 5), and the cure fraction (0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8). Then, we used the inverse cdf method to generate times drawn from an exponential mixture cure distribution for two separate groups. By introducing censoring and finding the minimum of the event times and censoring times, we generated observed time and event status. This allowed us to model the data with a Cox proportional hazards model, from which we obtained a hazard ratio, and a mixture cure model, from which we extracted out the odds ratio and the hazard ratio. 

When a dataset has a cure fraction, the Cox model is not correctly specified. The hazard ratio from the Cox proportional model is not giving a clear measurement because we have included a cure fraction in the data. Therefore, we might see the Cox model have misspecified power or type 1 error. . Instead, the cure model is correctly specified: the uncured distribution is an exponential distribution with one parameter, the hazard rate. Since we are fitting an exponential mixture cure model on exponential mixture data, our exponential mixture cure model is correctly specified.
